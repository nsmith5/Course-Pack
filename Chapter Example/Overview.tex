Here is an example overview. It turns out that measuring entropy is not something we can readily measure, it is usually
not a good idea to deal with internal energy directly. We can get around this problem by
doing what called a Legendre transformation. When we make a Legendre transformation to
E, we create a new function. Here is an example. Define a new function

$$G = E -TS $$

Why is this useful? To see this take the differential of Eq. (2),

$$dG = dE - TdS - SdT = TdS - PdV - TdS -SdT +\mu dN = -SdT -PdV +\mu dN $$

As above, if we interpret Eq. (3) in the context of a calculus function of multiple variables,
we conclude that G = G(T, V, N ). The function G is called the Helmholtz free energy. So, by
the Legendre transformation trick, we made a state functions that changed the description
